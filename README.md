# Sudoku-Puzzles

We created a program that solves Sudoku puzzles by using Backtracking.
You can input your unsolved Puzzle in "board" yousing the number 0 as the empty slots. Then as you run the code you can see the solved puzzle in the terminal. 
we used the "printBoard" function to print the board in a sorted 3 by 3 squares display so it is easier to read.
